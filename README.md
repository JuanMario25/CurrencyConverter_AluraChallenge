<h1>Currency Converter Alura Challenge</h1>

<p>This project is a challenge proposed by Alura Latam, developed in the Java programming language.
Its main goal is to convert a base currency to a target currency using exchange rate data obtained 
from the Exchange Rate API.
This app is executed from the terminal, where it displays a menu to interact with the user.
It is possible to choose the base currency, the target currency, and the amount of money you wish to 
convert. Finally, the app generates a JSON file with the details of the operation. You can repeat this
process until you choose the exit option to close the app.</p>
